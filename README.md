# My-Kodi-Scripts

These scripts are used to customize buttons on a Harmony 665 remote with LG C8 TV for controlling Kodi running on a Nvidia Shield with flirc as IR reciever. These should be compatible with other IR solutions, but IR codes will change based on TV/remote. The keymap addon for Kodi can be used to identify IR codes. 

The .xml file is a keymap file, and should be placed in \internal\Android\data\org.xbmc.kodi\files\.kodi\userdata\keymaps

The .py python scripts should be placed in their own folder, keymap is set to look for them in /storage/emulated/0/scripts/
